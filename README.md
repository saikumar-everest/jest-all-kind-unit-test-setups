# jest-all-kind-unit-test-setups

:book: Purpose of this project is to act as reference :notebook: for all kind of unit test setups written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test framework

We encourage [AAA(Arrange - Act - Assert) format](http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert) for structuring any unit(actually any!) test.

> Note: These setups are just some of the possible to write. I agree that, for the same test, one can write with many different setups also.

### List of different test setups for scenarios

Visit each folder and you should find a brief description about the test scenario and test setup.


### :gear: How to run tests
